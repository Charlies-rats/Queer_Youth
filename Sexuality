<h2>Gay</h2>
	<p>Gay is a term generally used to describe when a man or man-aligned* person is attracted specifically to another man or man-aligned person, but it is also used as an umbrella term for anyones attraction to the same gender.</p>

<h2>Bi and Pan</h2>
	<p>Bi and pan is the attraction to two or more genders. Within this community, there has been dispute on the difference between the two. I personally do not know the difference, but bisexuality is more categorized as the attraction to both male and female.</p>

<h4>*A woman or man aligned person is someone who is not entirely a woman or man, but feels more alined with that label. For example, a nonbinary person can still be a lesbian if they are woman-aligned and feel attraction mainly to women.</h4>
